							<h2>University Projects</h2>
							<p>These are some of the projects I have done in college (Due to the nature of the assignments, I am not allowed to publicly share the source code of my project):</p>
							<ul class="alt">
								<li><b>Banking database:</b> This was a collaborative project done in my Database Systems course, where we were told to utilize SQL to create a database for an entity. We decided to create a banking database with a simple web front-end. HTML and Javascript was used to create the front-end of the project, with C++ being used for data generation of the sample data and SQL used for the database initialization and queries. Functionalities of the project included a user login, user privilege management, depositing, withdrawing, transfers, and loans.</li>
								<li><b>MIPS Assembler:</b> This was an individual project conducted in my Computer Architecture course where the task was to translate a file containing code in MIPS assembly language to machine code. The entire project was written in Python and used NLTK to help tokenize various bits of code.</li>
								<li><b>Frog Crossing a River Game:</b> This is an individual project conducted in my Operating Systems course where the task was to create a small game using multi-threading. The project was written in C++ and utilized ‘pthreads’ to make the game work. The game consisted of simple graphics by using various text elements to symbolize the elements.</li>
								<li><b>Code Manipulation with Python's AST:</b> This is a two-part individual project conducted in my Software Engineering course which was written in Python and used the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) library. The first part of the project was to use the AST to perform mutation testing by negating different operators throughout a given sample code and print out variables in the given sample code. The second part of the project was a larger task which involved counting the amount of undefined variable uses through a given faulty script.</li>
